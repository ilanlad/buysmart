            <h2>Blockchain 101</h2>
            <p>Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger. It's like a digital chain of blocks where each block contains transaction data. In the context of the Australian shopper, it ensures that online transactions are secure and trustworthy.</p>
            <p>Why is it gaining popularity? Because once data is added to the blockchain, it's nearly impossible to change it without altering all subsequent blocks, which provides an unmatched level of security.</p>

Benefits of blockchain include its decentralized nature, which ensures no single point of failure, and its transparency, building trust among users.</p>
