            <p>The shopping landscape is evolving rapidly with the advent of new technologies. Blockchain, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence are paving the way for an innovative and secure shopping experience.</p>
            <h2>Blockchain-Driven Transparency</h2>
            <p>Blockchain technology is set to revolutionize supply chains, ensuring product authenticity and traceability. Consumers can verify the origin of products, ensuring they're ethically sourced and genuine.</p>
            <h2>Personalized Shopping with AI</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide tailored shopping experiences. From product recommendations based on your preferences to virtual trial rooms using Augmented Reality, shopping is becoming more personal and immersive.</p>
            <h2>Shopping with Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>As digital currencies become more mainstream, we can expect to see stores, both online and offline, accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more. It's not just about a new payment method; it's about decentralized finance and greater financial control.</p>
            <h2>Smart Contracts for Warranty</h2>
