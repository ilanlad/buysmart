            <h1>Blockchain 101</h1>
            <p>At its essence, a blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger. Imagine a book where you record every transaction you make; blockchain is a digital version of that book, but it's open for everyone to read, and once an entry is made, it's nearly impossible to alter.</p>
            <h2>Why is it Decentralized?</h2>
            <p>Unlike traditional databases, such as a SQL database, which are controlled by singular entities, blockchains are spread across a network of computers (called nodes). Each of these nodes has access to an up-to-date version of the blockchain. Therefore, there's no single point of failure, making blockchains highly robust against malicious attacks.</p>
            <h2>Immutability: The Core of Blockchain</h2>
            <p>Once data is added to the blockchain, it becomes almost impossible to change it. This feature ensures that transactions are secure and trustworthy. Each block on the blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data, forming a chain.</p>
            <h2>Applications Beyond Cryptocurrency</h2>
            <p>While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most renowned applications of blockchain technology, its potential extends far beyond. It's being explored in sectors like supply chain, healthcare, real estate, and, of course, online shopping!</p>
            <h2>Blockchain in Australia</h2>
            <p>Australia is embracing blockchain with an eye to the future. Recognizing its transformative potential, various sectors, including the Australian Government, are exploring its applications for better transparency, efficiency, and security in digital transactions.</p>
